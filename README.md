QUESTION 1 – FORMATTED OUTPUT

Create a program that displays the output given below. You will need to make use of the Escape Sequence characters to format the text correctly.
Hints: The backslash (\) and the double quotes (“) are both special characters. To make them appear in a string as normal characters, both need a backslash in front of them. For example, “\\” gives a single backslash as a normal character, whereas “\”” gives a double quote character.
Note: You are required to use formatted output to line up the columns. To line up the columns, do not manually insert whitespace characters, do not use the tab combination \t. Use printf and formatting template to achieve column width instead.
The following is a sample run output:
